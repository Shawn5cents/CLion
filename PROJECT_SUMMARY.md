## User Experience

### Primary Commands

1. **Code Review**: `clion review --file <path>`
   - Analyzes code and suggests improvements
   - Provides diff-format changes
   - Interactive approval process

2. **Error Fixing**: `clion fix-error <command>`

3. **Explain Mode**: `clion --explain <command>`
   - Shows detailed reasoning
   - Displays token usage and costs
   - Provides full transparency

### Workflow Examples

#### Code Review Workflow
```bash
# Review a single file
clion review --file src/main.cpp

# Review with project context
clion review --file src/main.cpp --explain

# Review with custom rules
clion review --file src/main.cpp --rules .clionrules.yaml
```

#### Error Fixing Workflow
```bash
# Fix build errors
clion fix-error "cmake --build ."

# Fix with specific compiler
clion fix-error "make CXX=g++-11"

# Fix with custom rules
clion fix-error "make" --rules .clionrules.yaml
```
